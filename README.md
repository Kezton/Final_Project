# Final_Project
This project is based on morphological classfication using Deep COnvolution Neural Network. It 
shows how computational cosmology could help to make hard classificaiton easy. The galaxy can 
be classified in various ways, they can be in three classes namely - Elliptical, Spiral, Irregular or 
they could be classified more deeper as Disk, Smooth, Bulge, Spiral etc.
This project uses astroNN dataset, This dataset is generated from Sloan Digital Sky Survey , and 
the labels comes from Galaxy Zoo. We can even preprocess Galaxy Zoo and can convert it into 
three main labels - Elliptical, Spiral, Irregular. Galaxy10 SDSS is a dataset contains 21785 69x69 
pixels colored galaxy images (g, r and i band) separated in 10 classes
